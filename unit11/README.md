# Honeypot Assignment

**Time spent:** **X** hours

**Objective:** Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. Present your findings as if you were requested to give a brief report of the current state of Internet security. Assume that your audience is a current employer who is questioning why the company should allocate anymore resources to the IT security team.

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** How did you deploy it? Did you use GCP, AWS, Azure, Vagrant, VirtualBox, etc.?
- Deployed mhn-admin virtual machine using Google Cloud Platform. 
  - Ubuntu 18.04 Minimal
  - HTTP Traffic Allowed (Port 80)
  - TCP Ports 3000 & 10000 open to allow incoming traffic for geolocation and honeypot sensor data
- Google Cloud default region and zone:
```bash
gcloud config set compute/region us-east4

gcloud config set compute/zone us-east4-c
```
- Google Cloud firewall rules:
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules list

gcloud compute firewall-rules create http \
    --allow tcp:80 \
    --description="Allow HTTP from Anywhere" \
    --direction ingress \
    --target-tags="mhn-admin"

gcloud compute firewall-rules create honeymap \
    --allow tcp:3000 \
    --description="Allow HoneyMap Feature from Anywhere" \
    --direction ingress \
    --target-tags="mhn-admin"

gcloud compute firewall-rules create hpfeeds \
    --allow tcp:10000 \
    --description="Allow HPFeeds from Anywhere" \
    --direction ingress \
    --target-tags="mhn-admin"
```
- Google Cloud VM creation:
```bash
gcloud compute instances create "mhn-admin" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
    --subnet "default" \
    --maintenance-policy "MIGRATE" \
    --tags "mhn-admin" \
    --image-family "ubuntu-minimal-1804-lts" \
    --image-project "ubuntu-os-cloud" \
    --boot-disk-size "10" \
    --boot-disk-type "pd-standard" \
    --boot-disk-device-name "mhn-admin"
```
- Establishing SSH connection:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh mhn-admin
```

### Database Backup (Required) 

**Summary:** What is the RDBMS that MHN-Admin uses? What information does the exported JSON file record?

*Be sure to upload session.json directly to this GitHub repo/branch in order to get full credit.*

### Deploying Additional Honeypot(s) (Optional)

#### X Honeypot

**Summary:** What does this honeypot simulate and do for a security researcher?

### Malware Capture and Identification (Optional)

#### X Malware

**Summary:** How did you find it? Which honeypot captured it? What does each malware do?

MD5 Hash: *Run `md5sum` on the file and record the hash here.*

SHA1 Hash: *Run `sha1sum` on the file and record the hash here.*
